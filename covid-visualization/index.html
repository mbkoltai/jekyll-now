  <h1>Tracking the pandemic</h1>

  <div class="entry">
    <p>This post includes graphs of the dynamics of the COVID19 pandemic, as well as notes that I am making on the economics and politics of the pandemic. Notes on mathematical modeling of the epidemic <a href="https://mbkoltai.github.io/covid-modeling/">are in the science section</a>. As of early April (9th of April) the notes are rather messy, I plan to clean them up with time.</p>

<p>I am mainly interested in structural analysis of how the pandemic will change society, especially on the medium/long-term.</p>

<h2 id="1-data-visualization">1. Data visualization</h2>

<p>The data source for all these plots is the central database by <a href="https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/raw/master/csse_covid_19_data/csse_covid_19_time_series">Johns Hopkins University</a>.</p>

<h3 id="total-number-of-cases-by-date-logarithmic-y-axis">Total number of cases by date (logarithmic y-axis)</h3>

<p>This is showing the cumulative number of confirmed COVID19 cases in the major European countries, the US and some of the major Asian countries. The numbers are plotted by date.
The 5 biggest European countries by population (Germany, UK, France, Italy and Spain) have a combined population almost exactly equal to the US, so it is useful to plot them also as a group, this is shown by ‘<em>IT_ES_FR_DE_UK’</em>.
The insets show European countries plus the US and Asian countries, respectively.
The dashed blue lines on the left inset show the dates:</p>
<ul>
  <li>20/February: exponential increase of cases starts in Italy</li>
  <li>26/February: exponential increase of cases starts in France</li>
  <li>09/March: countrywide lockdown in Italy</li>
  <li>16/March: countrywide lockdown in France (announced, effective from 17th noon)</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="total-number-of-cases-aligned-logarithmic-y-axis">Total number of cases, aligned (logarithmic y-axis)</h3>

<p>Same as the previous plot, but countries are aligned to start from the same number of cases as Italy had on the 26th of February (or the day they had the closest value).</p>

<h3 id="number-of-new-cases-in-europe-and-the-us">Number of new cases in Europe and the US</h3>

<p>Number of new confirmed cases by date for Western countries and Russia only. The dashed blue lines show the start of the lockdowns in Italy (02/March, 09/March) and France (16/March).</p>

<h3 id="number-of-daily-deaths-in-europe-and-the-us">Number of daily deaths in Europe and the US</h3>

<h3 id="growth-rate-of-cases-on-total-number-of-cases">Growth rate of cases on total number of cases</h3>

<p>This plot shows the percentage (fractional) growth of the total number of cases, as a function of the total number, with time going from left to right. The growth rate is averaged over a sliding window of three days.</p>

<h4 id="why-italy-has-a-very-high-case-fatality-rate-cfr">Why Italy has a very high case fatality rate (CFR)?</h4>
<p><a href="https://medium.com/@andreasbackhausab/coronavirus-why-its-so-deadly-in-italy-c4200a15a7bf">% of old people/all cases much higher</a><br />
Reason for many older ppl infected: <a href="https://twitter.com/kuhnmo/status/1238421146837684224">20% of Italians 30-49 still live at home</a><br />
+ testing policy was changed late March bc of capacity limits, and only testing severe cases, so the number of confirmed cases is smaller, so ratio of death/confirmed cases grows.</p>

<p>Summary on modeling efforts to estimate costs of lockdowns vs letting the virus spread.
Early estimates suggested even a year-long lockdown more economically viable.
They made an estimate for economic loss due to deaths.
Important finding: usually fatality rates <em>fall</em> during economic crises (less accidents etc), even if suicides might increase.</p>

<p>1-sentence summary of MMT (cf Keynes: if we can do it we can afford it):
‘<em>provisioning society (..) is not a financial issue. If we can’t produce enough masks, ventilators or food, finance will not help. Society’s capacity to produce real output is what limits its ability to provision itself. And this is precisely what the virus threatens, as workers stay home, supply chains break down and businesses shut their doors.</em>’
