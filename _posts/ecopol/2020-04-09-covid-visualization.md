This post includes graphs of the dynamics of the COVID19 pandemic, as well as notes that I am making on the economics and politics of the pandemic. Notes on mathematical modeling of the epidemic [are in the science section](https://mbkoltai.github.io/covid-modeling/). As of early April (9th of April) the notes are rather messy, I plan to clean them up with time.

I am mainly interested in structural analysis of how the pandemic will change society, especially on the medium/long-term.

## 1. Data visualization

The data source for all these plots is the central database by [Johns Hopkins University](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/raw/master/csse_covid_19_data/csse_covid_19_time_series).

### Total number of cases by date (logarithmic y-axis)

This is showing the cumulative number of confirmed COVID19 cases in the major European countries, the US and some of the major Asian countries. The numbers are plotted by date.
The 5 biggest European countries by population (Germany, UK, France, Italy and Spain) have a combined population almost exactly equal to the US, so it is useful to plot them also as a group, this is shown by '*IT_ES_FR_DE_UK'*.
The insets show European countries plus the US and Asian countries, respectively.
The dashed blue lines on the left inset show the dates:
- 20/February: exponential increase of cases starts in Italy
- 26/February: exponential increase of cases starts in France
- 09/March: countrywide lockdown in Italy
- 16/March: countrywide lockdown in France (announced, effective from 17th noon)

### Total number of cases, aligned (logarithmic y-axis)

Same as the previous plot, but countries are aligned to start from the same number of cases as Italy had on the 26th of February (or the day they had the closest value).

![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/covid/cases_cntrs_tracking_italy_log.png)

### Total number of deaths, aligned from same starting point (y logscale)

Same as the previous plot, but for cumulated number of fatalities.

![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/covid/deaths_cntrs_tracking_italy_log.png)

### Number of new cases in Europe, US and Asia (logarithmic y-axis)

Plotting the number of new cases by date, for the same Western (+Russia) and Asian countries.

![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/covid/newcases_west_vs_asia_w_china.png)

### Number of new cases in Europe and the US

Number of new confirmed cases by date for Western countries and Russia only. The dashed blue lines show the start of the lockdowns in Italy (02/March, 09/March) and France (16/March).

![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/covid/newcases_west.png)

### Number of daily deaths in Europe and the US

The dashed blue lines show the lockdowns of Italy (02/March, 09/March) and France (16/March).

![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/covid/newdeaths_west.png)

### Growth rate of cases on total number of cases

This plot shows the percentage (fractional) growth of the total number of cases, as a function of the total number, with time going from left to right. The growth rate is averaged over a sliding window of three days.

### Growth rate of deaths on the total number

As previous plot, but for the number of fatalities. The growth rate is averaged over a sliding window of three days.

#### Why Italy has a very high case fatality rate (CFR)?
[% of old people/all cases much higher](https://medium.com/@andreasbackhausab/coronavirus-why-its-so-deadly-in-italy-c4200a15a7bf)  
Reason for many older ppl infected: [20% of Italians 30-49 still live at home](https://twitter.com/kuhnmo/status/1238421146837684224)  
\+ testing policy was changed late March bc of capacity limits, and only testing severe cases, so the number of confirmed cases is smaller, so ratio of death/confirmed cases grows.

But they only talk abt the sources ('exotic' food), not demand driving it and networks.
Also growth of slums and incorporating rural communities into urban networks, so forest disease dynamics show up in cities v fast (cf. Mike Davis Planet of Slums). 'Post-agricultural' regions.  Deforestation + periurban lack of health infrastructure.
'Sylvatic pathogens' (wild animal pathogens) burned out in the forest before now entering susceptible human populations (no healthcare) ---> networks of travel/trade.

'The lengthier the associated supply chains and the greater the extent of adjunct deforestation, the more diverse (and exotic) the zoonotic pathogens that enter the food chain.
Among recent emergent and reemergent farm and foodborne pathogens, originating from across the anthropogenic domain, are African swine fever, Campylobacter, Cryptosporidium, Cyclospora, Ebola Reston, E. coli O157:H7, foot-and-mouth disease, hepatitis E, Listeria, Nipah virus, Q fever, Salmonella, Vibrio, Yersinia, and a variety of novel inﬂuenza variants, including H1N1 (2009), H1N2v, H3N2v, H5N1, H5N2, H5Nx, H6N1, H7N1, H7N3, H7N7, H7N9, and H9N2.'

China’s wildlife farming has evolved into a gigantic business interest. In 2016, the industry produced 520.6 billion yuan (USD 81.3 billion) in revenue. The part of wildlife farming that supplied the exotic food market accounted for 24 per cent (125 billion yuan or USD 19.5 billion) of the total output.

Summary on modeling efforts to estimate costs of lockdowns vs letting the virus spread.
Early estimates suggested even a year-long lockdown more economically viable.
They made an estimate for economic loss due to deaths.
Important finding: usually fatality rates *fall* during economic crises (less accidents etc), even if suicides might increase.

[LR Wray in Guardian: Coronavirus has destroyed the myth of the deficit](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/17/coronavirus-deficit-american-economy)

1-sentence summary of MMT (cf Keynes: if we can do it we can afford it):
'*provisioning society (..) is not a financial issue. If we can’t produce enough masks, ventilators or food, finance will not help. Society’s capacity to produce real output is what limits its ability to provision itself. And this is precisely what the virus threatens, as workers stay home, supply chains break down and businesses shut their doors.*'
Advocates Green New Deal, resisting deficit hawks after pandemic.
