I have not posted recently about Trigg's book on reproduction schemas as I got into reading on the (in)famous 'transformation problem' and could not resist playing with some of the models in the literature. I will not discuss here how the 'transformation problem' is usually formulated, there is a lot of literature available on that. Instead, I want to present a dynamical model (proposed in Kliman 1988 with numerical examples, but without the equations) of prices of production where the aggregate equalities (total price) = (total value) and (total surplus value) = (total profit) are satisfied, and total supply can be sold in each period of production.
The model has the following assumptions and properties:  
1) value is expressed in prices, there is only one accounting system  
2) non-labor inputs transfer their value to the products they are used up for, but no more or less  
3) a given amount of labor adds the same amount of value  
4) profit can therefore only originate from unpaid labour: less is paid for wages than the amount of new value added by labour, the difference between the latter and the former appears as profit (for the *total* economy not for an individual sector)  
5) the system shows [simple reproduction](https://mbkoltai.github.io/reprod_multipl2/) only: it is producing the same physical amounts of goods in each period, and the physical surplus (output minus inputs used up) takes the form of consumption goods only, and is consumed in each period instead of being redirected (accumulated) into the systems as new capital goods or new consumption goods for an expanding workforce. The amount of non-labour inputs (constant capital) and work performed do not change.  
6) the real wage is kept constant: the wage paid for workers enables them to buy the same amounts of consumption goods. The nominal wage can however change if the unit price of consumption goods change.

Of course assumptions *2-4* can be (are) contested, and the idea that human labour is the only source of new value and therefore of profit can be rejected, but this - ie. the validity of the labour theory of value - is a topic for another post. Assumption *5* is just a convenient first assumption, but the system can be changed to expanded reproduction by altering its coefficients.
Here I only want to present a small mathematical model (based on the assumptions above) that is internally consistent and has a dynamics that can be made more realistic by introducing more detail. That the system is dynamic is important because then prices and profit rates can change, which is a precondition to incorporate crises in the model.
Like in the input-output models I [discussed previously](https://mbkoltai.github.io/reprod_multipl2/) we have two economic sectors (or departments), the first (*D1*) producing capital goods, the second (*D2*) consumption goods (*CoG*). Since we are dealing with simple reproduction (we are abstracting from fixed capital, all capital goods are used up in each period of production), the total use of capital goods has to equal the total output of *D1*.
This gives us the equality
$$C_2 = V_1 + S_1
\tag{1}\label{balancing_cond}$$,
or in other words the exchanges between the two departments (wages + profits in *D1* = value of constant capital used up in *D2*) have to be equal.
But in one respect the current model will be very different from the one discussed in the case of input-output tables and this will change the meaning of the equality of Equation \eqref{balancing_cond}. In the input-output description it was assumed that unit prices for the two goods have to be the same when they enter as inputs and when they emerge as outputs in a given period of production ('simultaneous valuation'). This means that unit prices cannot change and what the system describes are the relative prices required to solve the system of algebraic equations that describe the input-output equalities (a uniform profit rate is usually assumed, which gives one more constraint for the price system, but even then, there is one more unknown than the number of equations, and only relative prices can be calculated). It is a model of equilibrium prices for given technical (input-output) coefficients and a level of real wage (units of *CoG* paid for a unit of labour performed). In fact, because of the fact that input and output prices are the same (and that profit rates are equal across sectors) in that description, both (relative) prices and the rate of profit are fully determined by these technical coefficients and the real wage rate (which is also a physical quantity), see [Kliman (1999)](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/095382599107165).  
In the model discussed here this assumption of the equality of input and output unit prices is dropped. Therefore, instead of a system of algebraic equations with the same unit prices on both the right and left side, we will have a system of difference equations, that we need to provide with initial values.
In short, in the simultaneous description we have unit prices as:
$$ \mathbf{p} = \mathbf{p}(\mathbf{A} + w \mathbf{l})(1+r)
\tag{2}\label{simul_val}$$

where $$\mathbf{p}$$ is the row vector of unit prices, $$\mathbf{A}$$ the input-output matrix, $$w$$ is the wage rate, $$\mathbf{l}$$ is the row vector of labour inputs (quantities) per unit of output of each commodity and $$r$$ is the profit rate. $$\mathbf{A}$$, $$w$$ and $$l$$ are given, whereas $$\mathbf{p}$$ and $$r$$ are the unknowns. Defining the 'augmented' input matrix $$\mathbf{M} = A + w l$$, we can write the profit rate $$r = (pX - pMX)/pMX$$, where X is the column vector of gross outputs (physical quantities), but note that this is not an independent equation but rather comes from $$ \mathbf{p X} = (\mathbf{p} \mathbf{M} (1+r))\mathbf{X} $$, so although $$r$$ can be calculated (given $$\mathbf{M}$$), but for production prices $$p$$ we can only have the relative prices, as any set of absolute prices with the same ratios will satisfy the equations.

In the dynamic description we have instead:
$$ \mathbf{p}_{t+1} = \mathbf{p}_t(\mathbf{A} + w \mathbf{l})(1+r)
\tag{3}\label{dynamic unit prices}$$
which is a system of difference equations, not algebraic ones. Here, the input unit prices are a given, they are data, and they are mapped onto the output prices by the technical coefficients and the wage rate. Moreover, because of the third assumption above and because input prices are now data, the profit rate can now be independently determined from the input unit prices, technical coefficients, the wage rate and the amount of labour performed as:
$$ r_{t,t+1} = (\mathbf{l}\mathbf{X} - \mathbf{p}_t w \mathbf{l} \mathbf{X})/
(\mathbf{p}_t (\mathbf{A} + w \mathbf{l}) \mathbf{X})
\tag{4}\label{profit_rate_dynamic}$$

Profit is the total amount of new value added minus the real wage of workers (quantity of consumption goods) times the input unit price of *CoG*. The rate of profit is then given by total input costs that are also defined by technical coefficients, the wage rate and the input unit prices. So the calculation of the profit rate only involves the input data of input prices and constants. Unit output prices however are the function of both the profit rate and input prices as can be seen from \eqref{dynamic unit prices}.

Now let us go back to the equality of simple reproduction in Equation \eqref{balancing_cond}:  
$$C_2 = V_1 + S_1 $$ (coming from $$W_1 = C_1 + C_2$$, $$W_i$$ being gross output of a sector)  
In the equilibrium description of input-output tables, where input and output unit prices are equal, this equality is a relation between the inputs and outputs of the same period: this is a description of equilibrium for a given set of technical and wage coefficients so in a sense there is only one period, if we take another set of coefficients then we need to calculate another set of equilibrium prices.
But in the dynamic description this balancing condition is across two periods: the output of one period is the input of the next. In value/price terms, the output of capital goods has to equal the input of capital goods in the *next* period. In physical terms (since it is simple reproduction) it is also true that the inputs (of one good) used up in the current period has to equal the output (of the same good) of the current period. But in terms of money the current period's output is the input of the *next* one, and it does not need to equal the input of this period, *unless* the difference equations for unit prices have reached their stationary value. So the equality in the dynamic setting will be:
$$C_1(t+1) + C_2(t+1) = W_1(t)$$.

Let us write the dynamic equations for the unit prices that contain no other time-dependent variables, but only constants. All other variables of the system are governed by the unit prices as follows (from now on I put the time index in parenthesis instead of a subscript, as I use subscripts for department indices):
- constant capital: $$C_1(t) = \alpha X_1 p_1(t)$$, $$C_2(t) = (1-\alpha) X_1 p_1(t)$$, since the total physical amount and sectoral distribution of capital goods do not change
- wages: $$V_1(t) = \beta_1 X_2 p_2(t) $$, $$V_2(t) = \beta_2 X_2 p_2(t)$$, since the real wage is defined as a fixed amount of consumption goods ($$X_2$$) that the wages can buy, and distribution of the workforce does not change
- revenue: $$m(t)=\mu X_2 p_2(t)$$, profit spent on consumption goods by capitalists
- total (gross) output: $$W_i(t) = p_i(t) X_i$$
- cost: $$K_1(t) = C_1(t) + V_1(t) = \alpha X_1 p_1(t) + \beta_1 X_2 p_2(t)$$, $$K_2(t) = (1-\alpha) X_1 p_1(t) + \beta_2 X_2 p_2(t)$$
- profit rate: $$ r(t) = \frac{L_T - (V_1(t)+V_2(t)) }{ K_1(t) + K_2(T)} = \frac{L_T - (\beta_1 + \beta_2) X_2 p_2(t)}{ p_1(t) X_1 + (\beta_1 + \beta_2) X_2 p_2(t) } $$ ($$L_T$$ is total labour performed)

Since the output (price) of the current period is the input of the next period, and gross output is input costs and a markup equal to the aggregate profit rate, we have:
$$p_i(t+1) X_i = W_i(t) = (C_i(t) + V_i(t)) (1 + r(t))
\tag{5}\label{unit_price_dynam_implicit}$$

Dividing by $$X_i$$ and substituting the expressions listed above we have:  
$$\begin{bmatrix} p_1(t+1) \\ p_2(t+1 )\\ \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} \alpha & \beta_1 X_2 / X_1\\ (1 - \alpha) X_1 / X_2 & \beta_2 \\ \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} p_1(t) \\ p_2(t)\\ \end{bmatrix} \frac{ p_1(t) + L_T/X_1 }{ p_1(t) + (\beta_1 + \beta_2) X_2/X_1 p_2(t) }
\tag{6}\label{unit_price_dynam_explicit}$$

This is a system of first-order, non-linear, autonomous difference equations, that - I think - cannot be solved analytically (so that $$p(t)$$ is a function of time and parameters only), but it is easy to simulate numerically, or solve for its fixed point (it is a quadratic equation, one positive solution).

I simulated the system in MATLAB with the following numerical values (also used in the article cited below as a reference): $$L_T = 300$$, $$ \alpha = 1/2 $$, $$ \beta_1 = 1/6 $$, $$ \beta_2 = 1/3$$, $$\mu = 1/2$$, $$ X_1 = 200$$, $$ X_2 = 300$$.
This is the plot of the dynamics of unit prices and some of the variables of the system:

![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/prices_prod_simple_reprod_sequential.png)

The system satisfies the following equalities (all in price terms, *not* physical quantities):
- $$W_1(t) = C_1(t+1) + C_2(t+1) = p_1(t+1) X_1 $$, output of capital goods equals input of capital goods in next periods
- $$W_2(t) = V_1(t+1) + V_2(t+1) + m(t+1) = p_2(t+1) X_2 $$, output of consumption goods in current period equals outlay on wages plus consumption from profit (revenue) in next periods
- $$ \sum m(t) = \sum W(t-1) - \sum K(t)$$, total revenue, ie. profit that can be spent on consumption equals the difference between the output of previous period minus outlays on wages and capital goods in the current period

Since unit prices are changing until we reach the stationary state, the amount of money needed for total outlays (wages + capital goods) is also changing, and since inputs (in this model) transfer their prices to the output, gross output in terms of price is also changing, though net value added does not. Once we reach the fixed point unit prices do not change anymore, and therefore nominal wages, nominal profit, outlays on capital goods and gross output also do not change anymore. This state is identical to the equilibrium price (equal input and output prices) solution to the system. But the dynamical system converges to this stationary state only because the technical coefficients, the physical productivity does not change in this model. If the parameters would change before the system would converge to the fixed point, then the pre-equilibrium behavior can go on and on. If we were to add additional detail to the model, this could be the first thing to add probably: ie. growing labour productivity. The other two obvious things to add for a bit more realistic model would be fixed capital and expanded reproduction (some of the surplus is recycled to the system). If we add these, then it might start to make sense to ask some questions for instance on how productivity growth will affect profitability. I will extend this simple model summarized by Equation \eqref{unit_price_dynam_explicit} in the coming posts.
