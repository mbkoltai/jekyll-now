These are notes on the science, mostly epidemiological modeling, of the COVID19 pandemic.
It includes some of my own data visualization on the pandemic and I plan to add SEIR modeling as well.
The models are not to be understood as predictions, I am pursuing it only as a private interest.

### <ins>Data visualization</ins>

On the plots below the x-axis shows the number of cumulative reported COVID19 cases and fatalities relative to a country's population (cases/deaths per million inhabitants).  
The y-axis shows the 3-day average of the number of new cases or fatalities per one million inhabitants.
Time is implicit on these graphs, moving from left to right, and each data point is one day.  
This way one can see how much of the population is known to have contracted the virus and what is the current rate of growth per one million people. This makes the situation in different countries visually comparable.  
All data downloaded from the [Johns Hopkins University database](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/tree/master/csse_covid_19_data/csse_covid_19_time_series) and the graphs were made in a [Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/mbkoltai/mbkoltai.github.io/blob/master/images/covid/covid_data.ipynb).

#### [School closures, event cancellations, and the mesoscopic localization of epidemics in networks with higher-order structure](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.05924.pdf)
Higher-order struct leads to mesoscopic localization (concentration into substructures).  
Individuals classified by # of contacts:  
$$S_k$$: % susceptible with k contacts  
$$I_k$$: % infected with k contacts  
Clique prevalence: average fraction of nodes within cliques of size *n*.

![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/covid/clique%20prevalence.PNG)

What does lower coupling mean?
There are two distributions that characterize the network:  
$$g_m$$: membership of nodes. $$S_m$$ is % of *S* with number *m* of memberships in higher order structures.  $$g_m \sim m^{-\gamma}$$  
p_n: distribution of clique size *n*. $$p_n \sim n^{-\gamma}$$  

If edges are removed, in the localized network there is a critical size n_c for cliques under which if enough edges are removed, then there are no infections anymore in these cliques.
Also, in localized networks global prevalence falls off much more sharply with stronger intervention, whereas effect is linear in 'delocalized' networks.

Variables are defined by master equations. This goes down after a week.
With active case finding the peak is lower and earlier.
With higher transmission rate this gets higher, converging to ~0.9.
But if structures are highly coupled (a), clique prevalence ~same for n [20,100].
With lower coupling (b) there is *mesoscopic localization*: global prevalence can be very low, but within cliques, much higher % of infection.  

#### [The Contribution of Pre-symptomatic Transmission to the COVID-19 Outbreak](https://cmmid.github.io/topics/covid19/control-measures/pre-symptomatic-transmission.html)  
Estimates that ~25% of transmission in Shenzhen was asymptomatic.

#### [Temporal variation in transmission during the COVID-19 outbreak in Italy](https://cmmid.github.io/topics/covid19/current-patterns-transmission/italy-time-varying-transmission.html)
Estimates on reproduction numbers in regions of Italy. Started from 3-4, falling towards 2.

#### [Substantial undocumented infection facilitates the rapid dissemination of novel coronavirus (SCIENCE, 16 March)](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/sci/early/2020/03/13/science.abb3221.full.pdf)

Estimates from a model + Bayesian inference.
Main findings (these are max probability estimates):
- 86% of infections were from undocumented cases in China *before travel ban of 23/january*.
- undocumented cases had 55% (mu*beta) transmission rate of documented ones (beta)
- undocumented cases were the source of 79% of documented cases

Model: dynamics of infections among 375 Chinese cities.
Spatial dynamics captured by # of passengers from city *i* to *j*.
Variables for each city: $$ S_i, E_i, I_i^r, I_i^u $$ (undocumented).
Simulations by 'iterated filter-ensemble adjustment Kalman filter (IF-EAKF) framework'.  
Inferred parameters:
- Z: average latent period
- D: average duration of infection
- $$\mu$$: transmission reduction factor for undocumented
- beta: transmission rate for documented
- alpha: fraction of documented infections
- theta: travel multiplicative factor

Reporting delay is included (from Gamma distribution).
Best-fitting parameter values identified by maximum likelihood.
They could distinguish between mu-alpha value pairs with different individual values but same product. They did simulations with all parameter value pairs (within certain range) and .
Delay of reporting crucial, this needs to be speeded up to stop the spread.

![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/covid/science_article_undocum_cases.PNG)

[SI](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/sci/suppl/2020/03/13/science.abb3221.DC1/abb3221_Li_SM.pdf) contains equations.
System of coupled ODEs: S_i is susceptibles in city *i*.
All terms normalised by total population (in that city).
D: <duration infection>  
Then effective reproduction number $$R_e=\alpha \beta D + (1-\alpha)\mu \beta\ D$$

System of ODEs are then solved stochastically: each RHS term is sampled from a Poisson distribution. So we take the current value of the variable and then sample from a Poisson distribution (the deterministic value is the lambda of the Poisson). This is for each RHS term!
Initial prior ranges for parameters are from Latin Hypercube Sampling.
Initial values for populations similarly sampled (eg. initial exposed).

Then the simulation results are mapped into reported cases by a separate delay model.
Delay is from a Gamma distribution approximated from data.
Movements between cities estimated from mobile apps: Tencent, Mobility Index from Baidu.
'Iterated' filtering to estimate model parameters.

#### [Imperial: Impact of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) to reduce COVID19 mortality and healthcare demand (16 March)](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/media/imperial-college/medicine/sph/ide/gida-fellowships/Imperial-College-COVID19-NPI-modelling-16-03-2020.pdf)

2 strategies:
1) mitigation: can reduce peak healthcare demand by 2/3 and deaths by 50%. Still 100s of 1000s of deaths
2) Suppression: preferable for countries that can achieve. Means social distancing for *whole* of the population. Need to be maintained until vaccine found, as there is rebound if interventions are targeted.

Individual-based simulation model. Mixing in different environments. Schools double per capita rate of contacts. Incubation time 5 days. Infectiousness starts before symptoms. R0: between 2 and 2.6. Individual infectiousness varies (gamma distribution).
Symptomatic cases self-isolate w 1 day delay. 5 day delay to hospitalisation.

Results:
- no measures: peak after 3 months, 80% of US/UK population infected. 30-time more demand for critical care beds than available. 2.2M dead in US, 0.5M dead in UK.
- mitigation: for 7 different levels of mitigation they make estimates for the reduction in peak bed demand and total deaths. For two values of R0 (2.2, 2.4) and 4 values of 'triggers' (cumulative ICU cases). Trigger means when policies (home quarantine etc) are switched on/off.
- suppression: all measures combined can keep ICU bed demand below UK surge bed capacity (5K). Adaptive triggering of suppression: on-off with some thresholds for # of ICU cases.
Even with most comprehensive suppression strategy in 2 yrs abt 30K deaths in UK.
Higher ON trigger and/or lower OFF -> more deaths etc.

#### [NECSI response to Imperial paper (Ferguson et al) 'Impact of non-pharmarceutical...'](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5b68a4e4a2772c2a206180a1/t/5e70eb32b16229792eb14836/1584458547530/ReviewOfFergusson.pdf)

They agree with Ferguson that suppression is needed to bring down R<sub>0</sub> below 1.
But they disagree w Ferguson claim that 2nd outbreak unavoidable, because according to NECSI during lockdown infectious ppl are identified and their contacts isolated.
Ferguson calculate new infections as fcn of infected % and immunity, but not the phase of trajectory (ergodicity).
Not true that resurgence starts from even 1 case, China data showed *only 5% of close contacts of infected tested positive*. Small outbreaks can be controlled by testing.
Ferguson ignores super-spreader events by ignoring 'fat tail distribution of contagion'.
But cutting off fat tail by banning events reduced $$R_0$$.
Ferguson use SIR ODE-model, not appropriate bc it ignores:
- local dynamics
- non-normal distrib. of infection events per person (superspreaders)
- dynamic or stochastic values for parameters (social response)

But Imperial model has different environments and it is agent-based, so maybe this is not fair.
Debate on this on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/yaneerbaryam/status/1239936951823843328).

NECSI probabilistic model. $$R_*$$: community transmission rate.
i_0_c: stochastic factor of initial foothold the virus gains in a community
i_c(t): # active infections in community *c*  
If infection not contained, $$exp(r_c t)$$  
After $$T_c$$ community implements aggressive suppression policies.
Infections decay as $$exp(-t/\tau_c)$$  
After intervention # of infections is:  
$$i_c(t)=( i_c^0 exp(r_c T_c) ) exp(-(t-T_c)/\tau_c)$$  
Community transmission $$\sim i_c(t) p(travel)$$  
Poisson process, average number of infected communities can be estimated by integrating the two sub-processes (until and after $$T_c$$).  
Calculate expected number of other communities infected by community $$c$$.  
It's assumed growth within one community is exponential until $$T_c$$ (intervention), then exponential decay after $$T_c$$.

#### [Imperial: Report 12: The Global Impact of COVID-19 and Strategies for Mitigation and Suppression (26 March 2020)](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/media/imperial-college/medicine/mrc-gida/2020-03-26-COVID19-Report-12.pdf)

Global estimates:
- *without intervention*: 7 billion infections and 40 millon deaths in 2020
- *mitigation*: with 60% reduction of social contacts, 20 million deaths avoided, all health care systems overwhelmed, in low income setting by factor of 25.
- *suppression*: 30-39 million deaths can be avoided (compared to no intervention strategy), depending on timing

Household size/structure is critical, differences result in different *attack rates* by age groups. Number of hospital beds/1000 population from [World Bank](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator?tab=all).
Estimates for 3 strategies of unmitigated, mitigation, mitigation+enhanced social distancing for elderly:
- hospitalisation rate: $$\sim$$ 3%, 2%, 2% (esimates for difference world regions on Fig 4).
- critical care: 1%, 0.5%, 0.2%
- deaths: 0.6-0.8%, 0.4%, 0.2%

'Despite higher rates of contact across older age-groups, we predict a lower incidence of severe
disease, hospitalisation and deaths in lower income settings. This is driven by the younger average age
of these populations.' (Figure 5)

Simulations for countries in different income groups: how ICU capacity would be exceeded under different suppression strategies and mitigation (Figure 6).
Table 1 summarizes estimates by regions. Two suppression scenarios with 0.2 and 1.6 deaths/100K population/week.
Unmitigated (world, total): 40M deaths, 1.9M deaths with suppression with trigger 0.2/100K pop/week, 10.4M with suppression with trigger 1.6/100K pop/week. Difference $$\sim$$ 5-fold between two suppression strategies in most regions.

#### [Macroeconomics of epidemics](https://www.kellogg.northwestern.edu/faculty/rebelo/htm/epidemics.pdf)

Interaction terms between economic variables and epidemiological ones are via consumption and work hour variables:
- consumption: $$\pi_1(S_t C_t^S) (I_t C_t^I)$$, $$C_t$$ consumption spending
- work: $$\pi_2(S_t N_t^S) (I_t N_t^I)$$, $$N_t$$ is work hours
and a general term $$\pi_3 S_t I_t$$

Newly infected: $$T_t$$, therefore susceptibles: $$S_{t+1}=S_t - T_t$$.  
Number of infected: $$I_{t+1}=I_t + T_t - (\pi_r + \pi_d) I_t $$  
Zoonotic introduction of virus into population: $$I_0{=}\epsilon,\ S_0{=}1{-}\epsilon$$  

How do the epidemiological variables affect the economic ones?
Pre-epidemic, the population is made up of identical agents optimizing the utility function:
$$u(c_t,n_t)=ln(c_t) - \frac{\phi}{2} n_t^2$$  

Following the outbreak we have the modified version of this utility function per compartments:
$$U_t^j$$: 'lifetime utility' of agent $$j$$ ($$j=s,i,r$$).

Agents have the budget constraint: $$(1+\mu_t)c_t^j=w_t \phi^j n_t^j + \Gamma_t$$
with $$\mu_t$$ tax on consumption, $$w_t$$ real wage, $$\phi^j$$ labour productivity, $$\phi^j=1$$ for $$j=s,r$$ and $$\phi^j{=}1$$ for $$j{=}I$$.

'Lifetime utility' functions for compartments (subpopulations):
- S (susceptible): $$U^s_t=u(c_t,n_t) + \beta [(1-\tau_t)U^s_{t+1} + \tau_t U^i_{t+1} ]$$, where $$\tau_t$$ is the probability that a susceptible person gets infected. This probability linearly increases with consumption and work, and the utilities of being susceptible or infected in next time step are inversely and proportionally scaled with $$\tau_t$$.
- $$U^i_t$$: Similar lifetime utility function for infected people, but dependence only on recovery and death rates.

First order conditions (first derivative equals 0) for consumption, work hours, $$\tau_t$$ calculated with Lagrange multipliers. Market clearing equilibrium for goods and labor, balanced gov. budget assumed (clearly not technically true, is this important?).  

To model healthcare collapse, quadratic dependence of mortality rate on total number of infected.
Treatment option introduces another parameter ($$\delta_c$$) from infected to recovered, this is probability of a cure discovered in a time period.
Vaccine similarly modeled in utility function of susceptibles.

Mapping epidem. parameters from Ferguson (2006) onto model parameters: approx. 1/3, 1/3, 1/3 transmission in household, general community, schools and workplaces. From BLS Time Use Survey authors estimate % of time in buying things, eating outside, this gives estimate for consumption-related transmission.  
Number of students and workers multiplied by estimates of contacts in those environments. This gives estimate for workplace transmission.
Labor productivity for infected people set to 80%, assuming 80% is asymptomatic (?) and those with symptoms do not work.  
Peak of newly infected fraction of the population approximately 7% in the SIR (no utility functions) model.  
In the SIR-Macro model infection impacts the economy by 1) reducing size of workforce 2) through the utility functions, households reduce their consumption and work hours. In turn, their reduced consumption/work decreases the probability of getting infected. Peak of infected lower (5%) at occurs later.
Recession is much more severe due to reduced consumption/work. If mortality rate depends on healthcare being overwhelmed, households absorb this effect via utility function by reducing their economic activity, exacerbating recession.
Vaccine or effective drugs have opposite effect, households cut back less.

Containment measures are modeled as a tax on consumption. Optimization is done on how containment measures are introduced in time.
The model assumes that infections cannot be completely suppressed if no vaccine, until population immunity achieved. Therefore early strong containment has high economic cost but followed still by an outbreak. In this framework containment should be escalated gradually as $$I$$ grows. But China, Korea seems to show that suppression is possible. Costs of containment policies referred to as 'Ramsey problem': costs vs. maximizing social welfare.

A 'smart containment' scenario is also modeled where it is assumed that planners know the health status of everyone and can maximimize overall social utility by blocking all infected from working. In this case there is no cost to containment, but this requires perfect knowledge. Ie. huge social returns on testing.

Medium note on a preprint.
If $$c\ p > (R_0-1)/(R_0-R_q)$$, then exponential decay of outbreak. $$R_0$$ ~ 2.4, $$R_q$$ ~ 0.3 (Wuhan estimate).
c: compliance to self-quarantine after testing positive  
p: true positive rate

Fastest test currently: RT-LAMP technology, 10-30 mins, based on RNA detection. Polymerase with reverse transcriptase activity amplifies viral RNA ---> H+ release ---> pH sensitive dye.
But: it requires 65C incubation (tap water?).
Alternatives:
- rolling circle replication
- in vitro viral replication assays

Oise heavily exposed to SARS-CoV-2. Infection attack rate (IAR) from antibody detection.
171/661 had antibodies, **26% IAR**, 0% IFR (fatality). Hospitalisation rate 5%.
Anosmia (smell blindness) and ageusia (loss of taste) good predictors of infection.
IAR for smokers 7% vs. 28% (smoking: 75% decrease in risk of infection). Asymptomatic infections 17%.
High school: 41% IAR, among parents only 10%. 661 participants in total. Median age 37, 38% male. 40% age 15-17, only 2 people over 65. Secondary IAR in households 10-11% (both for parents and siblings). In Shenzhen similar study found 15%.
ELISA antibody tests were also made on blood samples of blood donors in the area, 3% IAR.
Oise was one of the early epicenters of the epidemic in France and these numbers are results of period before lockdown. Low prevalence numbers suggest herd immunity cannot be quickly established.
