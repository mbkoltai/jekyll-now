### About this site
My name is Mih√°ly B. Koltai and this is a website on both my professional work in systems biology and some of my other interests.

### Research interests

Since 2010 I have been working in the field of systems biology, ie. the mathematical modeling and quantitative analysis of biomolecular systems.

I am currently a postdoctoral fellow in the [Computational Systems Biology of Cancer](https://sysbio.curie.fr) group at the [Institut Curie](https://institut-curie.org) (Paris), a cancer research center in France.  

You can read about my published work in systems biology [here](https://mbkoltai.github.io/papers/) and blog posts on related topics [here](https://mbkoltai.github.io/blog/).

From time to time I also post on economic and political topics [here](https://mbkoltai.github.io/ecopol).
