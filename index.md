### About this site
My name is Mih√°ly (Bence) Koltai and this is a website on both my work in systems biology and my other interests, mainly in economic theory and modeling.

### Research interests

Since 2010 I have been working on the quantitative analysis of biomolecular systems, in a field often referred to as 'systems biology'. In practice this means building mathematical models to gain mechanistic understanding of biological systems and ideally formulate experimentally testable predictions about them.
I am currently a postdoctoral fellow in the [Computational Systems Biology of Cancer](https://sysbio.curie.fr) group at the [Institut Curie](https://institut-curie.org) (Paris), a cancer research center in France. The group uses mathematical models, data analysis and visualization to provide a quantitative framework to understand cancer.
You can read about my published work in systems biology [here](https://mbkoltai.github.io/papers/) and blog posts on related topics [here](https://mbkoltai.github.io/blog/).

I also have a strong interest in the quantitative modeling of economic processes, especially using theories from classical economics, I post about these topics [here](https://mbkoltai.github.io/ecopol).
