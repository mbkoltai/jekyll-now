# About this site
My name is Mih√°ly B. Koltai and this is my website on my work in mathematical biology and some of my other interests.

# Interests

Since 2010 I have been doing mathematical modelling in systems biology and infectious disease epidemiology.

I did [my PhD](https://archiv.ub.uni-heidelberg.de/volltextserver/20847/) in computational/mathematical biology in Heidelberg (Germany), and I am currently a research fellow in the [Centre for the Mathematical Modelling of Infectious Diseases (CMMID)](https://www.lshtm.ac.uk/research/centres/centre-mathematical-modelling-infectious-diseases) at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine.

To read about my published work in systems biology [here](https://mbkoltai.github.io/papers/) and posts on related topics [here](https://mbkoltai.github.io/blog/).

From time to time I also write on economic and political topics [here](https://mbkoltai.github.io/ecopol), where I try to combine qualitative social theory with quantitative analysis.
