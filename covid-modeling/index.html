  <h1>Notes on modeling the COVID19 pandemic</h1>

  <div class="entry">
    <p>These are notes on the science (mostly epidemiological modeling) of the COVID19 pandemic. As of early April (9th of April) the notes are rather messy, I plan to clean them up with time.</p>

<h4 id="school-closures-event-cancellations-and-the-mesoscopic-localization-of-epidemics-in-networks-with-higher-order-structure"><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.05924.pdf">School closures, event cancellations, and the mesoscopic localization of epidemics in networks with higher-order structure</a></h4>
<p>Higher-order struct leads to mesoscopic localization (concentration into substructures).<br />
Individuals classified by # of contacts:<br />
<script type="math/tex">S_k</script>: % susceptible with k contacts<br />
<script type="math/tex">I_k</script>: % infected with k contacts<br />
Clique prevalence: average fraction of nodes within cliques of size <em>n</em>.</p>

<p><img src="/images/covid/clique%20prevalence.PNG" alt="_config.yml" /></p>

<p>What does lower coupling mean?
There are two distributions that characterize the network:<br />
<script type="math/tex">g_m</script>: membership of nodes. <script type="math/tex">S_m</script> is % of <em>S</em> with number <em>m</em> of memberships in higher order structures.  <script type="math/tex">g_m \sim m^{-\gamma}</script><br />
p_n: distribution of clique size <em>n</em>. <script type="math/tex">p_n \sim n^{-\gamma}</script></p>

<p>If edges are removed, in the localized network there is a critical size n_c for cliques under which if enough edges are removed, then there are no infections anymore in these cliques.
Also, in localized networks global prevalence falls off much more sharply with stronger intervention, whereas effect is linear in ‘delocalized’ networks.</p>

<p>Variables are defined by master equations. This goes down after a week.
With active case finding the peak is lower and earlier.
With higher transmission rate this gets higher, converging to ~0.9.
But if structures are highly coupled (a), clique prevalence ~same for n [20,100].
With lower coupling (b) there is <em>mesoscopic localization</em>: global prevalence can be very low, but within cliques, much higher % of infection.</p>

<p>Estimates from a model + Bayesian inference.
Main findings (these are max probability estimates):</p>
<ul>
  <li>86% of infections were from undocumented cases in China <em>before travel ban of 23/january</em>.</li>
  <li>undocumented cases had 55% (mu*beta) transmission rate of documented ones (beta)</li>
  <li>undocumented cases were the source of 79% of documented cases</li>
</ul>

<p>Model: dynamics of infections among 375 Chinese cities.
Spatial dynamics captured by # of passengers from city <em>i</em> to <em>j</em>.
Variables for each city: <script type="math/tex">S_i, E_i, I_i^r, I_i^u</script> (undocumented).
Simulations by ‘iterated filter-ensemble adjustment Kalman filter (IF-EAKF) framework’.<br />
Inferred parameters:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Z: average latent period</li>
  <li>D: average duration of infection</li>
  <li><script type="math/tex">\mu</script>: transmission reduction factor for undocumented</li>
  <li>beta: transmission rate for documented</li>
  <li>alpha: fraction of documented infections</li>
  <li>theta: travel multiplicative factor</li>
</ul>

<p>Reporting delay is included (from Gamma distribution).
Best-fitting parameter values identified by maximum likelihood.
They could distinguish between mu-alpha value pairs with different individual values but same product. They did simulations with all parameter value pairs (within certain range) and .
Delay of reporting crucial, this needs to be speeded up to stop the spread.</p>

<p><a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/sci/suppl/2020/03/13/science.abb3221.DC1/abb3221_Li_SM.pdf">SI</a> contains equations.
System of coupled ODEs: S_i is susceptibles in city <em>i</em>.
All terms normalised by total population (in that city).
D: <duration infection="">  
Then effective reproduction number $$R_e=\alpha \beta D + (1-\alpha)\mu \beta\ D$$</duration></p>

<p>System of ODEs are then solved stochastically: each RHS term is sampled from a Poisson distribution. So we take the current value of the variable and then sample from a Poisson distribution (the deterministic value is the lambda of the Poisson). This is for each RHS term!
Initial prior ranges for parameters are from Latin Hypercube Sampling.
Initial values for populations similarly sampled (eg. initial exposed).</p>

<p>Then the simulation results are mapped into reported cases by a separate delay model.
Delay is from a Gamma distribution approximated from data.

<h4 id="imperial-impact-of-non-pharmaceutical-interventions-npis-to-reduce-covid19-mortality-and-healthcare-demand-16-march"><a href="https://www.imperial.ac.uk/media/imperial-college/medicine/sph/ide/gida-fellowships/Imperial-College-COVID19-NPI-modelling-16-03-2020.pdf">Imperial: Impact of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) to reduce COVID19 mortality and healthcare demand (16 March)</a></h4>

<p>2 strategies:
1) mitigation: can reduce peak healthcare demand by 2/3 and deaths by 50%. Still 100s of 1000s of deaths
2) Suppression: preferable for countries that can achieve. Means social distancing for <em>whole</em> of the population. Need to be maintained until vaccine found, as there is rebound if interventions are targeted.</p>

<p>Individual-based simulation model. Mixing in different environments. Schools double per capita rate of contacts. Incubation time 5 days. Infectiousness starts before symptoms. R0: between 2 and 2.6. Individual infectiousness varies (gamma distribution).
Symptomatic cases self-isolate w 1 day delay. 5 day delay to hospitalisation.</p>

<p>Results:</p>
<ul>
  <li>no measures: peak after 3 months, 80% of US/UK population infected. 30-time more demand for critical care beds than available. 2.2M dead in US, 0.5M dead in UK.</li>
  <li>mitigation: for 7 different levels of mitigation they make estimates for the reduction in peak bed demand and total deaths. For two values of R0 (2.2, 2.4) and 4 values of ‘triggers’ (cumulative ICU cases). Trigger means when policies (home quarantine etc) are switched on/off.</li>
  <li>suppression: all measures combined can keep ICU bed demand below UK surge bed capacity (5K). Adaptive triggering of suppression: on-off with some thresholds for # of ICU cases.
Even with most comprehensive suppression strategy in 2 yrs abt 30K deaths in UK.
Higher ON trigger and/or lower OFF -&gt; more deaths etc.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="necsi-response-to-imperial-paper-ferguson-et-al-impact-of-non-pharmarceutical"><a href="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5b68a4e4a2772c2a206180a1/t/5e70eb32b16229792eb14836/1584458547530/ReviewOfFergusson.pdf">NECSI response to Imperial paper (Ferguson et al) ‘Impact of non-pharmarceutical…’</a></h4>

<p>They agree with Ferguson that suppression is needed to bring down R<sub>0</sub> below 1.
But they disagree w Ferguson claim that 2nd outbreak unavoidable, because according to NECSI during lockdown infectious ppl are identified and their contacts isolated.
Ferguson calculate new infections as fcn of infected % and immunity, but not the phase of trajectory (ergodicity).
Not true that resurgence starts from even 1 case, China data showed <em>only 5% of close contacts of infected tested positive</em>. Small outbreaks can be controlled by testing.
Ferguson ignores super-spreader events by ignoring ‘fat tail distribution of contagion’.
But cutting off fat tail by banning events reduced <script type="math/tex">R_0</script>.
Ferguson use SIR ODE-model, not appropriate bc it ignores:</p>
<ul>
  <li>local dynamics</li>
  <li>non-normal distrib. of infection events per person (superspreaders)</li>
  <li>dynamic or stochastic values for parameters (social response)</li>
</ul>

<p>But Imperial model has different environments and it is agent-based, so maybe this is not fair.

<p>Uses simple SIR model to argue why suppression is needed, as mitigation leads to enormous death toll (some estimates on side-effects).
Suppression buys time for producing equipment, maybe drugs.
Not original research, but summarizes Imperial’s 16 March study.</p>

<p>Global estimates:</p>
<ul>
  <li><em>without intervention</em>: 7 billion infections and 40 millon deaths in 2020</li>
  <li><em>mitigation</em>: with 60% reduction of social contacts, 20 million deaths, all health care systems overwhelmed, in low income setting by factor of 25.</li>
  <li><em>suppression</em>: 30-39 million deaths can be avoided (compared to no intervention strategy), depending on timing</li>
</ul>

<p>Household size/structure is critical, differences result in different <em>attack rates</em> by age groups. Number of hospital beds/1000 population from <a href="https://data.worldbank.org/indicator?tab=all">World Bank</a>.
Estimates for 3 strategies of unmitigated, mitigation, mitigation+enhanced social distancing for elderly:</p>
<ul>
  <li>hospitalisation rate: <script type="math/tex">\sim</script> 3%, 2%, 2% (esimates for difference world regions on Fig 4).</li>
  <li>critical care: 1%, 0.5%, 0.2%</li>
  <li>deaths: 0.6-0.8%, 0.4%, 0.2%</li>
</ul>

<p>‘Despite higher rates of contact across older age-groups, we predict a lower incidence of severe
disease, hospitalisation and deaths in lower income settings. This is driven by the younger average age
of these populations.’ (Figure 5)</p>

<p>Simulations for countries in different income groups: how ICU capacity would be exceeded under different suppression strategies and mitigation (Figure 6).
Table 1 summarizes estimates by regions. Two suppression scenarios with 0.2 and 1.6 deaths/100K population/week.
Unmitigated (world, total): 40M deaths, 1.9M deaths with suppression with trigger 0.2/100K pop/week, 10.4M with suppression with trigger 1.6/100K pop/week. Difference <script type="math/tex">\sim</script> 5-fold between two suppression strategies in most regions.</p>
