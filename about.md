Since 2010 I have worked on the quantitative analysis of biomolecular systems, specifically cellular signaling networks, in the field that is usually referred to as 'systems biology'. I am currently uploading some of my work to this site and plan to shortly launch a blog too, where I want to review articles and topics that caught my interest.
